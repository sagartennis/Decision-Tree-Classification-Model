# Decision-Tree-Classification-Model
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on a feature (e.g. coin toss results in heads or tails), each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all features) and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. The paths from the root to the leaf represent classification rules.
